# Bootstrap-Portfolio

References (code found online)

Homework solutions (contact.html, index.html, portfolio.html) were copied to create a working framework/template for this assignment. These solution files/code were obtained from the NUEVA GitLab page, where they had been posted by our instructor, Phil Loy. Credit for much of CSS code goes to RCP Student [Nathaniel Quashie](http://github.com/bklynate) for his exemplary Bootstrap Portfolio. This reference solution is essentially [his submission for the Unit 2 homework assignment](https://github.com/bklynate/bootstrap-bp).
